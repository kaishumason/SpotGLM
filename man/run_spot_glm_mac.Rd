\description{
Fits a Spot-GLM model for multiple responses (e.g., genes) in parallel using memory-safe chunking
and \code{pbmclapply}, which relies on \code{mclapply}. Only available on Unix-based systems.
}
\details{
This version uses \code{pbmcapply::pbmclapply} for parallelism. On Windows systems,
please use \code{\link{run_spot_glm_windows}}.

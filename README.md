# SpotGLM
SpotGLM is an R package for performing **cell type-specific differential analysis**
in **spatial omics** data. It adapts to different data modalities, such as 
gene expression, chromatin accessibility, or isoform usage, and identifies
cell type specific changes associated with local tissue context.
**SpotGLM accounts for the mixed-cell composition inherent to spatial barcoding technologies**.
